[NFL Prediction with Logistic Regression](nfl-prediction-1.html)

The NFL season is upon us. Most pundits can barely pick over 50% of the games right. Can we use machine learning techniques to beat them? Using a PostgreSQL database, we can build statistical tables that fed into a logistic regression model to predict home team wins. We also strengthen our model using ridge regression, scaling, and cross validation.
