    "# Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever wonder who had the heaviest offensive line in the NFL? Or which team had the most penalties over the past few seasons? What if I told you that you didn't need to be an ESPN statistician to figure this out? What if---after a minimal investment in setup---you could easily query NFL data and start building your own predictive models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well I'm here to tell you that it is actually pretty easy to do---even for non-coders. After a few days of tinkering I was able to establish an easy to use, mostly accurate pipeline for analyzing NFL data. This post is directed towards people of all skill levels, but particularly novices.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you'll need:\n",
    "* Willingness to learn new things and to grind out the many small issues that inevitably arise\n",
    "* A computer running MacOS (or any other Unix based system)\n",
    "* Python\n",
    "* nfldb\n",
    "* PostgreSQL \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "Python is a powerful yet easy to use programming language capable of processing and analyzing data. It is widely used throughout the industry and is pre-installed on MacOS (although we will be using Python 3). There are about a million different tutorials you can use to become more familiar with how Python is used; I recommend [Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org). Interactive tutorials are available at [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/learn-python-with-anaconda?utm_source=Anaconda_download&utm_campaign=datacamp_training&utm_medium=banner).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Python is pre-installed on MacOS, I recommend installing it via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). Anaconda is a convenient bundle of Python and many of the additional libraries necessary to do data analysis. I will be using Python 3, so be sure to download that version (note that the download may take a while).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code can be edited and run either by the command line or an interactive development environment (IDE). I highly recommend using an IDE as they are significanlty more useful in working with code. Anaconda comes with **Jupyter** (what I am using to write and publish this article). Jupyter uses your web browser to allow you to edit and execute your code in chunks. However, I use [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/) to develop my code because it allows me to see variables, dataframes, arrays, etc. that I have generated. Once installed type either `jupyter notebook` or `spyder` in terminal and a new session will begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (structured query language) is an ancient method of querying databases. It's super easy to figure out once you see it in practice. The bulk of this post will be a series of queries designed to illustrate the basic functionality of SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL is a database management system that allows you to store and query your data using SQL. There are several ways to install PostgreSQL. You can either use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) method or [Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com). The Postgres App is the easiest option for MacOS. I am currently using [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) to view my data and test out different queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## NFLDB\n",
    "Once you have PostgreSQL setup, you are ready to get the NFL data. [nfldb](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb) is a module designed to scrape data from the NFL website and put it into a SQL table. The [instructions](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Installation) for installing nfldb are overly complicated, so here is a much more simple guide. Basically, all you need to do is create a blank Postgres datbase, run the SQL file, and then make a minor configuration change. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a list of instruction you will need to type into your command line. On Mac, simply open terminal and make sure you are in your `~` (aka your root directory). If you are unsure what the name of your `~` directory is, open finder and look at the name next to the house icon. Your terminal should open to `~` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open terminal and type `psql` to launch PostgreSQL\n",
    "2. Type `CREATE DATABASE nfldb;`, then `\\connect nfldb`, and then `CREATEUSER nfldb;`\n",
    "3. Download the [SQL file](http://burntsushi.net/stuff/nfldb/nfldb.sql.zip) and unzip it to your `~` directory\n",
    "4. Make sure terminal is in your `~` directory and type `psql -U nfldb nfldb < nfldb.sql`. This should create an empty NFL database in PostgreSQL\n",
    "5. Now type `pip install nfldb` to install the Python code necessary to fill in the NFL database\n",
    "6. Now type `locate config.ini.sample`. It should return a path like `/usr/local/share/nfldb/config.ini.sample`. Highlight this path and copy it\n",
    "7. Type `mkdir -p $HOME/.config/nfldb` and press enter\n",
    "8. Type `cp <paste the path from step 6 here> $HOME/.config/nfldb/config.ini`\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it! Everything should work now. The [installation guide](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Installation) has a few exercises to make sure everything is up and running. "
