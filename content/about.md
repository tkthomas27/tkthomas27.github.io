# About Me

>The grandeur of my physique, the complexity of my worldview, the decency and taste implicit in my carriage, the grace with which I function in the mire of today’s world -- all of these at once confuse and astound.
> ---John Kennedy Toole
> When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him

## Professional

I am a Research Associate at Harvard Business School working in the Accounting and Management unit. My work is quite broad, involving everything from processing unstructured data, analyzing financial data, writing cases, digesting vast quantities of research, directing film crews in India, and typesetting documents. Among other published works, I have written a cases on corporate governance at Airgas and tax inversions at Walgreens as well as a teaching note on corporate governance.

Most of my work is collecting and processing data. The data I primarily work with is either from WRDS (CRSP and Compustat mostly) or from private employers (e.g., sales, employee performance data). Each dataset provides unique challenges in sanitizing, managing, and combining---especially when tailoring the data for a particular research agenda.

I am a major proponent for the free and open source languages R and Python. I particularly am a fan of R Notebooks because of its ability to encapsulate the ideals of literate programming and leverage some of the typesetting power of Latex. Jupyter is also nice and one day, when peace reigns on earth, all will use literate programming instead of stitching together Stata, Excel, and Word.

Despite my preference for R, Python's generality in application makes it a much more versatile tool that I use when a project calls for something like web-scraping. Many times a project will be a mix of R, Python, and Bash.

I also have some practice in website building in Python and PHP. I use Python to build this blog and I have used the MAMP stack to build and manage web apps.

## Personal

My wife, my daughter, and I currently live in the Boston metro area. I moved here a few years ago to study Buddhism at Harvard Divinity School. Before that, I went to Furman University were I double majored in Philosophy and Religion. To answer your first two questions:

1. **Why did you study religion?** I studied religion because it's an impossible topic. You can never be "correct" when discussing someone's most deeply held convictions---no matter how much you try to abstract the topic into other genres of study like literature, sociology, or archaeology. I was initially attracted to Buddhism in particular for its impressively expansive expression of ideas. As I studied Buddhism, I became increasingly interested in its role as a cultural currency in a pan-Asian civilization.
2. **How did you get into business and/or computer stuff?** I got an opportunity at HBS and then worked really hard. Once I got in as a research associate there was a need to quickly expand my technical skills. As I was teaching myself coding and statistics, I came to realize that the orderliness of the data science and math well suited my temperament organizing research and had strong links to the logic I studied in philosophy. 

Outside of academics I like to:

* Play the guitar (Gretsch Duo Jet Center Block; classical guitar) and bass (Squier Jaguar, all black). Rocksmith is a blast and I try to play everyday!
* Read Sci-Fi. I'm currently on a quest to read all the "classics" in the genre (unfortunately this means a lot of Heinlein). My top two are currently *Dune* and *Hyperion*.
* I don't watch movies as much as I used to, but my favorite movies are from Leone and Kurosawa.
* I am big sports fans. I am biased towards the Carolina Panthers (NFL) and UNC-Chapel Hill in college sports (and the Hornets I guess). I am also of the opinion that the college sports $>>$ professional sports but that opinion is verbotten in New England despite the fact that it literally invented college sports.

# About the Blog

This is a blog about whatever I think is interesting. To be honest with you the only purpose of this blog is to help me remember all the cool stuff I learn everyday and to share it with others.

Given how popular and useful data science and computers in general are, I will try to focus this website towards those topics. I can't begin to tell you how indebted I am to the blogs of others who help to explain everything from `algorithms` to `zsh`. That being said, I can't promise topics on history, philosophy, economics, some of that old time religion won't makes it way into the blog.

## The Scholars Review

The Scholars Review is an infrequent collection of various things I've found interesting. The structure will typically be:

* *Chips from a Cambridge Workshop*: The title alludes to Max Müller's famous collection of essays and letters on a variety of works. This section will be repository for random things I found engaging with an emphasis on the Humanities
* *Tech Tips*: This section will give a brief elaboration on some useful bit of code, discuss helpful software, or talk about broader topics in the tech world
* *Economist Digest*: I do love the Economist. In this section, I will briefly summarize a few select articles or rant about something of which the article has reminded me
* *Sport*: A discussion of the current state of Sport and ruminations on past glories.
* *Entertainment*: A digest of what I've read, watched, and listened to recently.
* Others: from time to time I will also have sections on this week in history, the weather, events in the news, etc.

## The Logo

The site's logo is a reference to the vain attempts at squaring the circle. For me, it specifically recalls the life Thomas Hobbes, a renowned philosopher who one day passed an open book of geometry and became obsessed with the world of math.

## A Note of the Word "Data"

I refuse to use the word `data` as a plural. You wouldn't say you came from the mūsēō, so why should you treat `data` any differently?
