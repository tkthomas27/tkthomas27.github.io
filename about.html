    <h1>1 About the Blog</h1>
<p>This is a blog about whatever I think is interesting. To be honest with you the only purpose of this blog is to help me remember all the cool stuff I learn everyday and to share it with others.</p>
<p>Given how popular and useful data science and computers in general are, I will try to focus this website towards those topics. I can't begin to tell you how indebted I am to the blogs of others who help to explain everything from algorithms to zsh. That being said, I can't promise topics on history, philosophy, economics, some of that old time religion won't makes it way into the blog.</p>
<h2>1.1 The Scholars Review</h2>
<p>The Scholars Review is weekly collection of various things I found interesting that week. The structure will typically be:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Chips from a Cambridge Workshop</em>: The title alludes to Max Müller's famous collection of essays and letters on a variety of works. This section will be repository for random things I found engaging with an emphasis on the Humanities</li>
<li><em>Tech Tips</em>: This section will give a brief elaboration on some useful bit of code, discuss helpful software, or talk about broader topics in the tech world</li>
<li><em>Economist Digest</em>: I do love the Economist. In this section, I will briefly summarize a few select articles or rant about something that the article reminds of.</li>
<li><em>Sport</em>: A weekly discussion of the current state of Sport and ruminations on past glories.</li>
<li><em>Entertainment</em>: A weekly digest of what I've read, watched, and listened to of the course of the week.</li>
<li>Others: from time to time I will also have sections on this week in history, the weather, events in the news, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.2 The Logo</h2>
<p>The site's logo is a reference the vain attempts at squaring the circle. For me, it specifically recalls the life Thomas Hobbes, a renowned philosopher who one day passed an open book of geometry and became obsessed with the world of math.</p>
<h2>1.3 A Note of the Word "Data"</h2>
<p>I refuse to use the word <code>data</code> as a plural. You wouldn't say you came from the mūsēō, so why should you treat <code>data</code> any differently?</p>
<h1>2 About Me</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The grandeur of my physique, the complexity of my worldview, the decency and taste implicit in my carriage, the grace with which I function in the mire of today’s world -- all of these at once confuse and astound.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2.1 Professional</h2>
<p>I am a Research Associate at Harvard Business School working in the Accounting and Management unit. My work is quite broad, involving everything from writing cases, digesting vast quantities of research, directing film crews in India, and typesetting documents. I have written a cases on corporate governance at Airgas and tax inversions at Walgreens as well as a teaching note on corporate governance.</p>
<p>Most of my job, however, is collecting and processing data. The data I primarily work with is either from WRDS (CRSP and Compustat mostly) or from private employers (e.g., sales, employee performance data). Each dataset provides unique challenges in sanitizing, managing, and combining -- especially when tailoring the data for a particular research agenda.</p>
<p>Sometimes you get to play with a sexy workflow like shuttling data from the WRDS servers to a PostgreSQL database and feeding that into Stata. But most of the time its simply download, tab, summarize, hack. As any data scientist would tell you, managing data is most of work and the fun stuff like regression and classification is really just the icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Stata is a very popular language at HBS; Excel is also widely used and has its merits. However, I am a major proponent for the free and open source languages R and Python. I particularly am a fan of R Notebooks because of its ability to encapsulate the ideals of literate programming and leverage some of the typesetting power of Latex. Jupyter is also nice, but RStudio is a superior developing environment. That being said, Python's generality in application makes it a much more versatile tool.</p>
<p>My current obsession is streamlining my workflow which has lead me to expanding the power of <code>shell</code> and experimenting with <code>vim</code> and <code>bash</code> alternatives. As someone who has been bitten by the upgrade bug (when all your dependencies go to hell after updating one piece of software), I've also come to prize efficient ways to manage packages and updates. I'm also a big fan of version control, being both an avid user of git and developing my own system for use on HBS's git-unfriendly server.</p>
<p>I also have some practice in website building in Python and PHP. I use Python to build this static blog and I have used the MAMP stack to build and manage web apps. Additionally, I do enjoy typesetting in Latex (thank you Don Knuth).</p>
<h2>2.2 Personal</h2>
<p>My wife and I currently live in the Boston metro area. I moved here a few years ago to study Buddhism at Harvard Divinity School. Before that, I went to Furman University were I double majored in Philosophy and Religion. To answer your first two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why religion?</strong> I studied religion because it's probably the weirdest thing you can study, and to me that makes it the most interesting. Studying religion is basically a never ending Keanu Reeves "Whoa."</li>
<li><strong>How did you get into business and/or computer stuff?</strong> I got an opportunity at HBS and then worked really hard. Once I got in as an RA there was a need to quickly expand my technical skills. Luckily, computer science is essentially just logic -- which I've been studying all along as a philosophy student! Here's a game: go to a random Wikipedia article, click on the first word, and then keep clicking on the first word of each subsequent article. You will end up at the philosophy paper in at least 10 clicks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Outside of academics I like to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play the guitar (Gretsch Duo Jet Center Block; classical guitar) and bass (Squier Jaguar, all black). Rocksmith is a blast and I try to play everyday!</li>
<li>Read Sci-Fi. I'm currently on a quest to read all the "classics" in the genre (unfortunately this means a lot of Heinlein). My top two are currently <em>Dune</em> and <em>Hyperion</em>.</li>
<li>I don't watch movies as much as I used to, but my favorite movies are from Leone and Kurosawa.</li>
<li>I am big sports fans. I am biased towards the Carolina Panthers (NFL) and UNC-Chapel Hill in college sports (and the Hornets I guess). I am also of the opinion that the college sports <span class="math">\(&gt;&gt;\)</span> professional sports but that opinion is verbotten in New England despite the fact that it literally invented college sports.</li>
