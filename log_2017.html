<p><em>British Discovery of Buddhism</em>: This book concerns the early British mappings of “Buddhism.” I think this is a critical fact that most have a hard time accepting: there was singular idea of Buddhism as a pan-Asian civilizational religion that was delieverd wholesale to Europeans. It was a idea that was crafted over decades of discovery and interaction. The implication being that practitioners of Buddhism probably had wildly divergent ideas of what Buddhism was that what western scholars had crafted.</p>

<p><em>Ascent of Money</em>: Relistening to the <em>Ascent of Money</em> by Niall Ferguson. The two most interesting narratives from the book is the rise of the Rothschilds. The Rothschilds were textile traders in continental Europe who opened up shop in England before the Napoleonic era. To continue their business under Napoleon’s protectionist continental system, the Rothschilds became adept at smuggling gold into Europe. Needing to fund their armies in Portugal, Britain turned to the Rothschilds to deliever gold.</p>

<p><em>The Storm Before the Storm</em>: An interesting story about Marius: to demonstrate his vivacity despite his age, Marius exercised strenuosuly on the Campus Martius. Everyone laughed at him. Not to long after this, Marius had to flee Sulla on foot through swamps and over water, so his survival was due in large part to this exercise. While fleeing, Marius told the few people brave enough to accompany him the story of how he discoverd a nest of seven eagles as a child — thus prophesing his eventual return to Rome to claim his seventh consulship</p>

<p>Conditional expectation tells us that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E(Y \vert X=x) = \sum_{i=1}^k y_i \text{Pr}(Y=y_i \vert X = x)
\]</span></p>
<p>In words, the expected value of Y given a particular value of X is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each value of Y when X=x. Let’s say X takes two values, 2 and 3, and Y takes on many values from 0-100. For conditional expectation, we want to know what the expected value of Y when X=2. To do this we would just sum all the values of y multiplied by their probabilities whenever X=2.</p>
<p>The Law of Iterated Expectations tells us that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E[Y] = \sum_{i=1}^l E(Y \vert X = x) Pr(x=x_i)
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E[Y] = E[E[Y \vert X]]
\]</span></p>
<p>Essentially, the law of iterated expectations asks, what if we took a conditional probability of Y on X but then did it for every value of X. If you do this, you are essentially just taking the expectation of Y because you are going over the entire Y space.</p>
<p>Covariance can be written as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{X,Y} = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^l (x_j - \mu_X)(y_i - \mu_Y) Pr(X=x_j,Y=y_i)

<p><em>Napoleon: A Life</em>: I’ve heard that the Siege of Petersburg in the American Civl War was first modern battle due to its extensive use of artillery and trench warfare. However, the Battle of Eylau during the Napoleonic wars may be an even earlier example due to its use of artillery and overall brutality. The French Marshall Ney commented, “What a massacre! And without a result.”</p>

<p>When interpreting regression results it is valuable to remember that the <em>ceteris peribus</em> interpretation is due to the coefficients being partial derivatives. A derivative is simply defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_0 + \Delta x) - f(x_0)}{\Delta x}
\]</span></p>
<p>In words, if <span class="math inline">\(y=f(x)\)</span> the change in y (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta y\)</span>) per change in x (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span>) is how much how much a function changes (<span class="math inline">\(f(x_0 + \Delta x) - f(x_0)\)</span>) given a change in x (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span>). Hence we get the standard derivative notation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dy}{dx} \equiv f&#39;(x) \equiv \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
\]</span></p>
<p>In both simple and multiple regression, we interpret <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>s in similar ways: a unit change in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> results in a <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> amount of change in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. But how can we ignore other coefficients in multiple regression? Because they are partial derivatives where one variable is held constant while the other is allowed to vary. For example, the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)\)</span> while holding <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> constant can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f_x&#39;(y) = \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x}
\]</span></p>

<li><em>Urth of the New Sun</em>: finished; what a strange book. I’m not sure I have any idea what happened. The language was certainly not as floral as previous books in the series, but the actions and significance were incredibly obscure. Most of the time I had no idea what was happening. That being said, I can totally see this being the next big HBO show to fill in after Game of Thrones.</li>
<li><em>Illuminatus</em>: half way through; what a strange and hilarious book. One of the funniest I’ve ever read. Hail Eris!</li>
<li><em>The Lost World</em>: almost done; what a strange combination of under-developed writing and thought provoking monologues. It definitely feels like Crichton really wasn’t into the dino-terror part and just wanted to talk about evolution and extinction. Also interesting how much the movie deviates from the book since Crichton had to rush the book out before the next movie.</li>

<p>Having a newborn means you can’t sleep but you’re too tired to work. So what do you do? Bing watch:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Spaced</em>: Absolutely hilarious. Edgar Wright’s first big project is one of the funniest TV shows I’ve seen.</li>
<li><em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>: First season, not so great. Interesting to see that Rob Bowman (who directed many classic <em>X-Files</em> episodes) directed a lot of the first two seasons.</li>
<li><em>Logan</em>: I thought it was great if not a little too comically violent for the tone it was going for. But it is a fitting send off and one that certainly respects the characters.</li>
<li><em>BvS:DoJ</em>: The beginning of this movie is hilarious. A man standing in an office watching the entire city get destroyed around gets a call from his boss telling him he should leave the building. Why does someone need to tell you that! The world is clearly ending!</li>
<li><em>MST3K</em>: I think the new MST3K is superior to old one. I said it.</li>
<li><p><em>Hacksaw Ridge</em>: Hugo Weaving could have won an Oscar for his performance but his accent is out of control.</p></li>
<li><em>Innovators</em>: finished; actually pretty epic in scope and detail. One of the big takeaways was how different the internet could have been (e.g., anonymity could have been banned).</li>
<li><em>Misbehaving</em>: almost finished; a history of behavioral economics from Richard Thaler’s point of view. As someone who works in academia, it is interesting to see how fraught the advancement of new field is.</li>
<li><p><em>Revisionist History</em>: a new podcast by Malcolm Gladwell — pretty good! The topics are quite eclectic which suits me just fine!</p></li>

Is it possible?</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle for Amazon will be regulatory not economic. As the Economist continually points out, current regulations regarding monopolies and the like are outdated for times when custom data and smart algorithms can competitively set prices that normally would only appear under monopolies. Eventually regulations will catch up and Amazon as we know it might become multiple Amazon-lets.</p>

Over the past few months, Vix has been surprisingly low—and some fear it is the calm before the storm.

The Shiller 10-year PE <a href="http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/">suggests</a> that were about 10 percentage points above the historically observed median. However, if realized returns are a bad predictor of future returns, then how much should we trust these signals of another recession?</p>

<p>Any English speaking society that would think a name like “Praise-God Barebone” is a good name, is probably a little strange. The most innovative aspect of the Puritans (of which Praise-God was a member) was their ability to be strange and old-fashioned at the same time (after all, anyone can be new and strange). The Puritans were obsessed with keeping things the way they were. As David Hackett Fischer points out in <em>Albion’s Seed</em>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the early records of the Bay Colony, the adjectives ‘new’ and ‘novel were pejorative terms.’ In 1639, for example, a special ‘day of humiliation’ was called in Massachusetts on account of ‘novelties, oppression, atheism, exesse, superfluity, idleness, contempt of authority…’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing most readers would zero-in on is the ‘day of humiliation.’ But Fischer focuses on something else: he notes that novelty is first in the list—even ahead of atheism. It seems odd to us in our ever-innovating, fast-paced society that even the most conservative person would prefer no change at all. Fischer suggests that part of their desire to keep things the way they were (are?) was to preserve a memory of their lost home in England. You have to remember that the Puritans were upper-middle class merchants with deep roots in East Anglia who were forced to flee Europe after being branded as ‘fanatics.’ This could also explain why colonial Virginians (a slightly less fanatical population) also considered words like ‘innovation,’ ‘novelty,’ and ‘modern’ to be pejorative terms. Ironically they to were forced to flee to the new world after the Puritans briefly took control of England under Oliver Cromwell.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, wouldn’t a strange name like “Praise-God” be novel? And you would be right—I don’t think anyone who wasn’t a Puritan ever had that name. The Puritans, however, could justify this “new” name because of how it was derived. A common naming convention for the Puritans was to simply open the Bible at random and point to a word. So in a sense there is nothing new at all about—God chose the name, at random, from the book he wrote several hundred years ago.</p>
<p>On a broader note, I wonder how much of the progression of our knowledge of earth’s history has also impacted our view of innovation. Until very recently (the 19th c. in fact), the idea that a species could go extinct was patently absurd. The world is as it was when God created it. If the world is (as we know now) constantly in flux, then it is no great leap to embrace the change we inevitably must experience.</p>

<p>An ancient Greek <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox">adage</a> states: “a fox knows many things, but a hedgehog knows one important thing.” With no additional context, the adage simply bifurcates styles of epistemology without ascribing an upper-hand to either condition. Recently, however, I’ve seen the phrase used to describe winners and losers in the race for better, data-based predictions.</p>
<p>Philip Tetlock has centered his research on assessing and improving forecasts and makes clear his preference for foxes. His book <em>Superforecasters</em>, for example, details everyday people who consistently make better predictions than most experts regarding a wide range of world events. One reason for their success is their nearly obsessive collection of eclectic knowledge, making them “supernewsjunkies”. The core idea being that a critical quantity of information quanta can reveal patterns not recognized by large, over-arching narratives.</p>
<p>If you were to predict the future of oil prices, for example, would an intimate knowledge of OPEC’s history be all you need for accuracy? Or would you need to know how China’s aging population might affect aggregate demand for oil? Or what the median waterline on shipping vessels across the Pacific might reveal about global oil usage? What about CFOs who successfully hedge shale companies, keeping them afloat during a glut of oil? Many small details might give you an insight missed by the standard narrative.</p>
<p>Tetlock is not alone. Nate Silver in his book <em>The Signal and the Noise</em> also espouses a fox-outlook. His noted website <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com">538</a> subtly alludes to this with its fox logo.</p>

<li><em>Book of the New Sun</em> by Gene Wolfe: <code>COMPLETE</code>. What a strange book. In many ways it’s like reading the Bible - bizarre random things happening with no explanation or followup.

<p>I downloaded exercise files from Lynda for a <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Python-Programming-Efficiently/534425-2.html">course</a> in efficient python programming. I wanted to preserve the original files, so I made two copies of the files in different folders.

I modified some code I found online and used the following in the command line:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>for file in *.ipynb; do echo mv &quot;$file&quot; &quot;${file/begin./kt.}&quot;; done</code></pre>
<p>The files were named <code>xx_begin.pynb</code>. The above code renames all of these files by replacing the “begin” part with “kt”. A few points</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>for file in *.ipynb</code> creates a for loop that goes through each file ending in <code>.ipynb</code> (where each file name is saved to the variable <code>file</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>;</code> mark line breaks</p></li>
<li><p><code>do</code> and <code>done</code> demarcate the commands that are to be done in <code>bash</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>echo</code> will read out what is happening in the loop</p></li>
<li><p><code>mv</code> is what will use to rename the files. If a location is not specified, <code>mv</code> will simply rename the file where it is</p></li>

These tools allow you to run regressions, cluster analysis, PCA, etc. without ever typing a piece of code. It is interesting to see RapidMiner so high given its steep cost and all but useless free version.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice what is missing? SAS and Stata. Want to know why? They’re archaic and cost lots of money. The only reason they still exist is because of the imagined frictions of transitioning to R or Python.

<p><strong>Here There Everywhere: Quantum Computing</strong>: Just the other day I was wondering what it was like to be a US civilian just prior to the atomic bomb drop in 1945. Was there any idea that the US was working on a super weapon? What was it like to realize that your country had been secretly coordinating with the greatest minds on earth and spending billions of dollars developing an unstoppable instrument of destruction? What would be a current/future analog to this? Perhaps Russia attempts a major cyber attack on the US only to find out that America has developed a highly advanced quantum computer that not only renders the truly important parts of the US cyber infrastructure invulnerable, but also makes Russia an open book.</p>
<p>Timely enough, the technology quarterly for this week’s <em>Economist</em> focuses on quantum computers. The major take away is that progress in this field is rapidly advancing thanks to the growing and inevitable commercialization of quantum techniques. Quantum computers will soon provide more accurate location than GPS, more precise sensing abilities than anything available, unbreakable cryptography, and the ability to quickly solve problems in finance and engineering.</p>
<p>This last point reminds of the time saved in solving liner equations that came with the advance of analytical engines and early computers. Problems with 6+ unknowns would take weeks to solve, but advances in simple computers reduced the time to mere hours (your computer could probably do it in seconds).</p>

<p>Reading Walter Isaacson’s <em>Innovators</em>, I was struck by his telling of the first-long distance phone call. In the 1910s, AT&amp;T was facing the expiration of their patent on the basic technology underlying telephone calls. To compensate, AT&amp;T aggressively pursued new technologies such as long-distance phone calling. Sure enough, by 1915 Alexander Graham Bell recreated his famous first phone call with Thomas A. Watson, except this time a continent separated them and not a room.</p>
<p>I find it compelling how different it is today: namely, that a claim on intellectual property would be allowed to expire. Mickey Mouse, for example, should have gone into the <a href="https://priceonomics.com/how-mickey-mouse-evades-the-public-domain/">public domain</a> in 1984. However, due to intense lobbying, Disney has been able force changes in the law so that Mickey Mouse will almost always remain in the Disney vault. What kind of innovation has Disney denied the world by not letting their rodent mascot into the public domain?</p>

<p>On April 15, 1912 the RMS <em>Titanic</em> sank in the northern Atlantic taking the lives of approximately 1500 people. Stop anyone on the streets, and they certainly could tell you the general outlines of the disaster. But what about the sinking of the <em>Sultana</em>? On April 27, 1865 (April is the cruelest month), the steamboat <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sultana_(steamboat)"><em>Sultana</em></a> caught fire and sank on the Mississippi river killing roughly 1700 – 200 more than the <em>Titanic</em>.</p>
<p>So why does everyone remember the <em>Titanic</em> and not the <em>Sultana</em>. One reason is timing: the <em>Sultana</em> sank the day after John Wilkes Booth was killed after himself assassinating President Lincoln. Another reason would be media coverage and popular interest: the <em>Titanic</em> catered to social elites who the media naturally gravitates towards. Add in the morality play of the ship “that even God could not sink” sinking and killing most on board, and you have the perfect storm of everlasting infamy.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this isn’t the only dyad of famous/forgotten maritime disasters. Everyone knows about the <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spanish_Armada">Spanish Armada</a> – the most powerful naval force in the world dashed to pieces by the fury of a north Atlantic storm as it tried to attack England in 1588. Ultimately the loses Spain totaled 35 ships and 20,000 dead. But what about the <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/English_Armada">English Armada</a>? In the ensuing year, the English attempted a punitive expedition against Spain but met a similar fate losing 40 ships and upwards of 15,000 men.</p>
<p>A similar-in-magnitude pairing of remembered-and-forgotten can be found in the disastrous “kamikaze” invasion of the Mongols into Japan in the 13th century and the massive losses suffered by Roman naval forces in the second Punic war – both with high-end estimate losses of 100,000 men.</p>

<li><p><em>Financial Regulation in America: The Litter of the Law</em>: From 2010-2016, “Dodd-Frank soaked up 73m paperwork hours and $36bn in costs.” Small price to pay for the economic damage created by the financial industry in the Great Recession right? Maybe, but vengeance is not the point of the justice system and nor should it be the thrust of regulations. The idea of financial regulations is to act like the speed governor on your car. You should be able to drive to work any way you want but not at an extreme speed that would prove reckless to you or others. One proposed step in the article is to consolidate regulating agencies to lower the burden of compliance. Simplification, consolidation, and harmonization would make compliance more effective and help lower compliance costs for companies. However, if the continuing issues with IFRS-GAAP harmonization is any indication, this will probably never get done.</p></li>
<li><p><em>American Retailing: Run Ragged</em>: Retail is not the most thrilling field of research but it is a massive component of the economy and the gradual demise of storied franchises such as Macy’s and Sears are certainly touchstones in the changing economic landscape of America. The future, it seems, is fast-fashion (Zara’s, Uniqlo, Primark, etc.) and smaller stores.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Schumpeter: Snaptrap</em>: Now this is a thrilling topic of research: corporate governance. Snapchat’s recent IPO (looking for a $20-25bn valuation) continues the trend toward diminished shareholder rights for companies going public (particularly tech companies). For Snap, the problem is acute: shareholder’s buying into the IPO have no voting rights. Google and Facebook are similar with dual voting rights that divorces cashflow rights from voting rights. Alibaba’s attempt to follow suit in their IPO lead to them listing with the NYSE after the HKSE rejected their corporate governance structure. So why are tech companies such avid fans of these patently undemocratic structures? One argument is that tech companies, given their dependence on forecasting the future and secretive R&amp;D efforts, are more likely to have information that the market will be incapable of adequately pricing. Tech IPOs, by this argument, need to protect their interest from uninformed market forces.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.13</span> March 3, 2017</h2>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/2017-02-11">February 11, 2017 edition</a> of the Technology Quarterly</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Entertainment: The Paradox of Choice</em>: In his book <em>The Long Tail</em>, Chris Anderson famously predicted that the winners in the coming digital entertainment revolution (think Netflix) would be the ones who provided the most customized, expansive, and rare collection. Essentially, whatever service could lay claim to the most hard to get titles would be the winners. This has not proven to be the case. It seems that the easier it is to get things that were once rare (I remember scouring Best Buys for any copy of Kurosawa that I can now watch on youtube for free) people more and more want the biggest names in TV and movies. The winners it seems, are those who can get stream <em>The Force Awakens</em> and not <em>Rashomon</em>. (In hindsight this seems pretty obvious.)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Recommendation Algorithms</em>: In statistics, we obsess over the bias-variance tradeoff. When algorithms meet people, however, the tradeoff is explore-exploit. You could simply keep recommending things you know for sure that customers like, but this runs the risk of overfitting and failing to adapt to the vacillations of human desire. However, if you loosen your parameters to achieve lower errors when switching between human states, you might under-fit and the human will reject the recommendation as not applicable to them.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Alternative Realities</em>: The frictions involved in AR, VR, and Haptic immersion rigs (viz., they look stupid to wear and are uncomfortable) will probably limit their adoption to only those who play video games. Hence why I think the future is still in full eye replacements.</p></li>

<p>Here are few interesting factoids about names of places in the ancient world:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Iberia in Roman times did not refer to the Iberian peninsula (modern day Spain and Portugal) but to a Kingdom (the first Christian kingdom in fact) centered on present day Georgia.</p></li>
<li><p>The original province of Syria is approximately present day Syria. However, following the Bar Kokhba revolt, Hadrian (who really, really hated the Jews) merged Judaea into Syria to create the province Syria-Palestine. He also renamed Jerusalem Aelia Capitolina.</p></li>
<li><p>The name “Germania” is of unknown origin, probably a Gaulish term appropriated by the Romans. It is appropriate then that only non-Germans call Germany “Germany” and native Germans refer to it as Deutschland. The “Deutsch” part of Deutschland is ultimately from the PIE root “teuta” meaning “people.” This root is origin of the word “Teutons” as well as the Italian word for German, “tedesco.” <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Names_of_Germany">Wikipedia</a> makes the interesting point of contrasting the word for “people” with the opposite word “walesc” used to indicate “foreigner.” This word has been applied to the Welsh (who call themselves Cymry) as well as Wallonia (the Belgians who recently held the EU hostage in trade negotiations) and Wallachia (the home of Dracula).</p></li>

<p><strong>Super Bowl</strong></p>
<p>Stunning comeback or stunning collapse? An excellent <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/about-those-falcons-play-calls/">article</a> details how Falcons bumbled and the Patriots exploited a 99% chance of victory. Despite the Falcon’s mind-boggling calls down the stretch (attempting passes despite Devonta Freeman averaging 8 yards a carry and only needing to run out the clock), the story during the course of the game was how little the Falcons offense was on the field.</p>
<p>I would also be remiss if I didn’t point out that the Patriots almost Seahawked themselves by throwing a nearly intercepted pass from the two yard line at the end of the game.</p>

<p>Given Tom Brady’s legendary success in the NFL, much talk has been given to him as the “Greatest of All Time.” This is a fine argument, but two caveats should be noted. Is he the greatest player of all time? That is a definitive no. <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Red_Grange">Red Grange</a>, a charter member of both the college and professional football hall of fame, is undeniably the greatest of all time. Is he the greatest QB of all time? Perhaps. Outside of Peyton Manning (who might be the <em>best</em> QB of all time), the biggest competition Brady has is Otto Graham: in his 10 year career he went to 10 championship games and won 7 of them.</p>

<li><p><em>Universal Basic: Bonfire of the Subsidies</em>: I’m critical of UBI schemes in general because the income provided would dramatically cut the amount of welfare provided to the poorest while giving income to those who don’t need it. In India, however, such a scheme might actually prove beneficial in that it wouldn’t be “universal.” Instead, because Indian currency has very high purchasing power, it would replace at similar cost the current proliferation of welfare schemes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Augmented Reality</em>: AR is very cool, but “social factors often govern the path to mass adoption, and for AR, two problems stand out.” The first problem is aesthetics in that wearing the current headsets make you look like a Neal Stephenson gargoyle.

<p>The <code>Master Method</code> is a general tool for analysis of the run time of divide and conquer algorithms. The general form of the master method is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
T(n) \leq a T(n/b) + O(n^d)
\]</span></p>
<p>Here the parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the number of recursive calls</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the factor by which input shrinks until recursion is called</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the exponent on the combine step</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The relationship between these three parameters result in three different run times:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if <span class="math inline">\(a=b^d\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(O(n^d \space log \space n)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>if <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;b^d\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(O(n^d)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>if <span class="math inline">\(a&gt;b^d\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{log_b a})\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Mergesort, for example, has the form of <span class="math inline">\(T(n)=2 T(n/2)+O(n^1)\)</span>, which gives us a run time of <span class="math inline">\(O(n \space log \space n)\)</span>.</p>

<p>Most stars are binary in nature, i.e., most stars have a counterpart star that orbits a mutual barycenter. So what about our sun? What if our sun had a sibling? And what if that sibling was the cause of the mass extinctions that have periodically wracked earth? Such is the speculation that gave rise to the theory of <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nemesis_(hypothetical_star)">Nemesis</a>, a proposed star, small and very dark, that orbits with our Sun and periodically smashes through the Oort cloud every 26 million years, sending armageddon levels of debris to earth. In theory, this could include the impactor that lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs (if indeed they did go extinct from the impact of an extraterrestrial object).</p>
<p>This theory is quite engaging: it plays on our wonder at the enormity of the cosmos, the interconnectedness of time, as well as the possibility of mystery left in the universe. There is also something of the operatic in the idea of a long lost, evil twin who periodically ruins your life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as cool as this theory sounds, there is little evidence to support it. Despite being small and dark, such a body would have probably been detected by now. Furthermore the periodicity of mass extinctions has been challenged.</p>

<p>Things that describe Kary Mullis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avid surfer</li>
<li>Denier of HIV-Aids link</li>
<li>Married four times</li>
<li>Winner of Nobel Prize</li>
<li>Avid user of LSD</li>
<li>Encountered glowing green raccoon (possibly extraterrestrial)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of these is not like the other…</p>
<p>The work of Lenoir, NC-born Kary Mullis has had an enduring, epoch-defining influence on biology in spite of his unusual predilections and controversial views,. In particular, his Nobel-prize winning work on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was “highly original and significant, virtually dividing biology into the two epochs of before P.C.R. and after P.C.R.”</p>
<p>PCR is essentially a “kind of genetic photocopying, and it became the basis for all subsequent genetic science, from academic studies to police forensic work.” PCR relies on breaking done DNA and assembling a new copy of the strand with the help of heat-resistant polymerase. The end result of repeated applications are multiple copies of the original DNA strand. You can immediately see how this could be useful in forensic science: just a single hair fiber is now more than enough to produce sufficient DNA to test for comparisons to suspects.</p>
<p>As for Kary Mullis, well… maybe his autobiography is the best source of information: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dancing-Naked-Mind-Field-Mullis/dp/0679774009/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486654696&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kary+mullis"><em>Dancing Naked in the Mindfield</em></a>.</p>

<p>We all know Charlemagne: King of the Franks, First Holy Roman Emperor, coronated on Christmas Day in 800 CE. But what about Karl der Grosse? Or Carolus Magnus? This isn’t a mere translation issue — the equivalency of these two names points towards the fundamental similitude of Germany and France as well as the nearly universal appearance of the name “Charles.”</p>
<p>So Germany and France hate each other (see World War II, World War I, Franco-Prussian War… you know what — just check out the wikipedia page on the <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/French–German_enmity">French-German Enmity</a>). The EU was essentially founded to prevent another World War between the two — they even gave the Nobel Prize to themselves for so bravely refraining from war for a few decades. With this in mind, it’s a little awkward that France and Germany are historically the same. This issue is only possible because, until 1871, Germany wasn’t even a country and was more a general cultural idea.</p>
<p>Historically, France is a part of this idea — the Franks (France and Frankfurt, Germany) were a collection of Germanic tribes occupying the continental Europe north of the Alps. The most famous of the Franks (apologies to <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pepin_the_Short">Pepin</a>) is known almost exclusively by his French name Charlemagne (Char le Magne) despite that his name was actually Karl (Karl der Grosse). Add this to to wiki on “French-German Enmity.”</p>
<p>I remember thinking that it was pretty neat when I finally realized Charlemagne’s name is quite obviously “Charles the Great.” Investigating the relation between Charles, Char, and Karl, you quickly find an expansive list of other Karl derivatives: Carolina (North Carolina is named after Charles I, King of England), Charlotte (the city is named after the queen consort of George III), Caroline, Carla, Carl, Charlene, Carol, Carolyn, and Carlos.</p>

<p><em>The Multinational Company: In Retreat</em>: Multinationals, which account for a third of the world’s stock markets, are increasingly posting anemic performance results with declining profits and plunging ROE. The cause of this fall is that the opportunities that multinationals exploited in the international market are being “massaged” away: income is rising in the third world, mismatched tax treaties are being synchronized, and local firms are becoming more sophisticated.

The problem is, of course, that healthy people do end up subsidizing the unhealthy because the high-risk pools require extensive government backing which is turn funded by tax payers.</p></li>

<p>In this classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)#.22The_Butterfly_Dream.22">story</a>, the Chinese sage Zhuangzi (ca. 370 BCE) awakes from dreaming that he was a butterfly only to ask the question: am I a man dreaming of being a butterfly or am I a butterfly dreaming of being a man? Daoists, scholars, philosophers, poets, artists, and laymen alike have all been equally moved by so profound yet so simple of a question. Although the concept has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_argument">elaborated and explored</a> numerous times (there are certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasubandhu">more</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations_on_First_Philosophy">less</a> sophisticated takes on the idea), I believe Zhuangzi’s simple story has staying power due to its simultaneous depth and shallowness. The very form of the story, incredibly simple yet profound in implications, underlines the point that distinctions between deep and shallow — between anything in fact — is ultimately fruitless.</p>

<p>The earliest known representation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taijitu">Yin-Yang</a> is not from China but from the late Roman Empire (ca. 430). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notitia_Dignitatum"><em>Notitia Dignitatum</em></a>, which “details the administrative organization of the Eastern and Western Empires,” includes a depiction of the shield carrying a Yin-Yang symbol.</p>
<p>So does this mean China and Europe were trading ideas a millennium before the colonial period? Of course! Asia and Europe have been in contact for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Embassy_to_Augustus">long</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periplus_of_the_Erythraean_Sea">long</a> time. But <em>Notitia</em> is not the smoking gun. The current version of the <em>Notitia</em> is actually a Medieval copy of an ancient document — meaning that it’s about 1000 years younger than the 430 date.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Motoring_Enthusiast_Party">Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party</a> is a micro political party that remarkably won federal representation in 2013. Let’s review a few spectacular facts from this Australian <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-06-30/australian-motoring-enthusiasts-party-ricky-muir-begins-senate/5561076">news article</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Senator representing AMEP, Ricky Muir, is a 32-year-old former timber worker</li>
<li>Mr. Muir only won .51% of the primary vote</li>
<li>Mr. Muir will make $190,000 a year — $16,000 more than a US Senator</li>
<li>The party has no clear stances on any topic outside of anti-hoon regulations (FYI: hoon refers to making crazy car modifications and/or performing dangerous maneuvers in the street.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not an irrelevant <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21695553-prime-minister-threatens-early-election-bid-stamp-his-authority-turnbulls-big-gamble">incident</a>: in 2016, “eight senators representing tiny parties… hold the balance of power [in the Australian Senate].” Nor is it isolated: in 2016, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_(Iceland)">Pirate Party</a> won 10 seats in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Althing">Althing</a>. Ultimately, this represents a potential pitfall of the Parlimentary system (a system that many Americans would like to try out given the current two-party deadlock in America.)</p>

<p>As someone who started with Stata and R for data analysis, I’ve always wanted to try a more general use language like Python. I worked through <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org">Python the Hard Way</a> and played around with <a href="https://www.dataquest.io">Dataquest</a> (whose <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-setup-a-data-science-blog/">tips</a> helped me build this blog). However, the best way of learning I have found is writing algorithms in Python.</p>
<p>Two of the cooler functions I have come across are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#zip">zip</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists">pop</a>. <code>zip</code> essentially allows you to iterate over two iterables simultaneously. A trivial example would be</p>
<pre class="python"><code>x = [1,2,3]
y = [4,5,6]

for i,j in zip(x,y):
  print(i,j)</code></pre>
<p>the output would be <code>[1,4],[2,5][3,6]</code>. I can’t think of how much time this simple function would have saved me if it was available in Stata.</p>
<p><code>list.pop[i]</code> is like the opposite of <code>append</code>: it removes the specified element from the list. This might sound simple, but it is by far the easiest way of removing something from a list that I have come across in R or Stata. My first use of <code>pop</code> came in writing the <a href="https://github.com/tkthomas27/stanford_algos/blob/master/course1/count_inversions.py">inversion counting algorithm</a>. Here is a snippet (<code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are both arrays of numbers):</p>
<pre class="python"><code>while B and C:
    if B[0] &lt;= C[0]:
        outlist.append(B.pop(0))
    else:
        count += len(B)
        outlist.append(C.pop(0))</code></pre>
<p>This chunk of code does the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Checks if element 0 of <code>B</code> is less than or equal to element 0 of <code>C</code></li>
<li>If it is, then it removes that element from <code>B</code> and places it into <code>outlist</code></li>
<li>If it is not, then it increases <code>count</code> by the number of elements left in <code>B</code> (this is part of the counting inversions) and then removes that element from <code>C</code> and places it into <code>outlist</code> (the effect is two sorted arrays)</li>
</ol>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/2017-01-21">January 21, 2017 edition</a></p>
<p><em>Buttonwood</em>: This weeks Buttonwood column addresses one of the pitfalls of the current trend towards protectionist policies: shielding established yet failing companies from displacement by global competition. Specifically, a paper from the OECD finds that companies that owe more than they make (interest-coverage ratio of less than 1 and are over 10 years older) might be stifling growth and lowering labor productivity. These older, less profitable companies use their lobbying clout (leveraging their employment size, no doubt) to pressure their respective governments into passing protectionist policies. To be sure, however, this isn’t a Right v Left issue: Sandernistas and Corbynistas alike were clamoring for anti-globalist policies as well.</p>

<p><strong>NFL Conference Championship Games</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Patriots trounced the sleep-walking Steelers (I wonder how much that early morning wake up call affected them). I guess this should have been predictable, but the Patriots really haven’t played anyone recently so I though it would be closer. That being said, the Steelers implemented one of the worst gameplans in recent history by deciding to drop everyone in coverage and only sending a few rushers.</li>
<li>Similarly, the Falcons demolished Green Bay in another snooze-fest. I still think Aaron Rodgers is technically the best QB in the NFL right now, but even he can’t overcome the insane number of injuries they’ve had (particularly in the secondary.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>College Basketball</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Another great week of college ball. The ACC continually pumps out terrific matchups (see Florida State-Louisville). I think the storyline of the year so far is the failing of this Duke team. I know Coach K is gone, but come on this team is stacked!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>’Member when…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remember when Kansas won 12 games in 2007? And were ranked No.2 going into the last week of the season? Kansas hasn’t won more than 12 games in the <strong>past 6 seasons combined</strong>. 2007 has and forever will be the craziest year in college football.</li>

<p><strong>Watching</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Silence</em>: Martin Scorcese’s passion project about Jesuit priests in early-modern Japan was right in my wheel house. It was somber and slow (like a good Kurosawa film) and about a topic that I studied frequently during my time in at the Divinity School (that topic deserves it’s own post). I particularly appreciated the absence of a mustache-twirling evil Jesuit missionary priest.</li>
<li><em>Parks and Rec</em>: an affable comedy series that feels a little before it’s time given the current political climate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Listening</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>X-Files-Files with Kumail Nanjiani</em>: This is a fun podcast about the X-Files with <em>Silicon Valley</em> star Kumail Nanjiani. It’s pretty funny and appropriately intellectual given the excellent writing of the show. Some of his guests are quite good: Darin Morgan (Flukeman, writer of the best episodes of the X-Files), Glen Morgan (frequent writer for the X-Files, Darin’s brother), Chris Weitz (writer of <em>About a Boy</em> and <em>Rogue One</em>), and Dan Harmon (<em>Rick and Morty</em>) to name a few. I vividly remember watching the X-Files as a kid on Friday/Sunday nights and it’s been great reliving the zeitgeist of the moment.</li>
<li><em>Hacker’s: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em> by Steve Levy: This is a fun book about the history of hackers. So far I’ve finished the first part about the first hackers who grew out of the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT. Also of note is the hacker hatred of IBM — now that famous Ridley Scott-directed Apple commercial from the 1984 Super Bowl makes a lot more sense.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Forever War</em> by Joe Haldeman: a mildly interesting but not very well written novel about a solider who, via time dilation effects of interstellar travel, lives over thousand years. Not terrible, but I’m not sure why this won so many awards.</li>
<li><em>The Book of the Dying Sun</em> by Gene Wolfe: on a recommendation from a friend I started reading this sci-fi fantasy novel. So far it is definitely better written than <em>The Forever War</em> and quite good at evocative imagery. I find his extensive blend of imaginary, literary, and archaic words particularly amusing.</li>
