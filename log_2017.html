<p>Conditional expectation tells us that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E(Y \vert X=x) = \sum_{i=1}^k y_i \text{Pr}(Y=y_i \vert X = x)
\]</span></p>
<p>In words, the expected value of Y given a particular value of X is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each value of Y when X=x. Let’s say X takes two values, 2 and 3, and Y takes on many values from 0-100. For conditional expectation, we want to know what the expected value of Y when X=2. To do this we would just sum all the values of y multiplied by their probabilities whenever X=2.</p>
<p>The Law of Iterated Expectations tells us that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E[Y] = \sum_{i=1}^l E(Y \vert X = x) Pr(x=x_i)
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E[Y] = E[E[Y \vert X]]
\]</span></p>
<p>Essentially, the law of iterated expectations asks, what if we took a conditional probability of Y on X but then did it for every value of X. If you do this, you are essentially just taking the expectation of Y because you are going over the entire Y space.</p>
<p>Covariance can be written as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{X,Y} = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^l (x_j - \mu_X)(y_i - \mu_Y) Pr(X=x_j,Y=y_i)
\]</span></p>

<p><em>Napoleon: A Life</em>: I’ve heard that the Siege of Petersburg in the American Civl War was first modern battle due to its extensive use of artillery and trench warfare. However, the Battle of Eylau during the Napoleonic wars may be an even earlier example due to its use of artillery and overall brutality. The French Marshall Ney commented, “What a massacre!

<p>When interpreting regression results it is valuable to remember that the <em>ceteris peribus</em> interpretation is due to the coefficients being partial derivatives. A derivative is simply defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_0 + \Delta x) - f(x_0)}{\Delta x}
\]</span></p>
<p>In words, if <span class="math inline">\(y=f(x)\)</span> the change in y (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta y\)</span>) per change in x (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span>) is how much how much a function changes (<span class="math inline">\(f(x_0 + \Delta x) - f(x_0)\)</span>) given a change in x (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span>). Hence we get the standard derivative notation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dy}{dx} \equiv f&#39;(x) \equiv \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
\]</span></p>
<p>In both simple and multiple regression, we interpret <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>s in similar ways: a unit change in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> results in a <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> amount of change in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. But how can we ignore other coefficients in multiple regression? Because they are partial derivatives where one variable is held constant while the other is allowed to vary. For example, the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)\)</span> while holding <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> constant can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f_x&#39;(y) = \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x}
\]</span></p>

<p>Things that describe Kary Mullis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avid surfer</li>
<li>Denier of HIV-Aids link</li>
<li>Married four times</li>
<li>Winner of Nobel Prize</li>
<li>Avid user of LSD</li>
<li>Encountered glowing green raccoon (possibly extraterrestrial)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of these is not like the other…</p>
<p>The work of Lenoir, NC-born Kary Mullis has had an enduring, epoch-defining influence on biology in spite of his unusual predilections and controversial views,. In particular, his Nobel-prize winning work on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was “highly original and significant, virtually dividing biology into the two epochs of before P.C.R. and after P.C.R.”</p>
<p>PCR is essentially a “kind of genetic photocopying, and it became the basis for all subsequent genetic science, from academic studies to police forensic work.” PCR relies on breaking done DNA and assembling a new copy of the strand with the help of heat-resistant polymerase. The end result of repeated applications are multiple copies of the original DNA strand. You can immediately see how this could be useful in forensic science: just a single hair fiber is now more than enough to produce sufficient DNA to test for comparisons to suspects.</p>
<p>As for Kary Mullis, well… maybe his autobiography is the best source of information: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dancing-Naked-Mind-Field-Mullis/dp/0679774009/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486654696&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kary+mullis"><em>Dancing Naked in the Mindfield</em></a>.</p>

<p>We all know Charlemagne: King of the Franks, First Holy Roman Emperor, coronated on Christmas Day in 800 CE. But what about Karl der Grosse? Or Carolus Magnus? This isn’t a mere translation issue — the equivalency of these two names points towards the fundamental similitude of Germany and France as well as the nearly universal appearance of the name “Charles.”</p>
<p>So Germany and France hate each other (see World War II, World War I, Franco-Prussian War… you know what — just check out the wikipedia page on the <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/French–German_enmity">French-German Enmity</a>). The EU was essentially founded to prevent another World War between the two — they even gave the Nobel Prize to themselves for so bravely refraining from war for a few decades. With this in mind, it’s a little awkward that France and Germany are historically the same. This issue is only possible because, until 1871, Germany wasn’t even a country and was more a general cultural idea.</p>
<p>Historically, France is a part of this idea — the Franks (France and Frankfurt, Germany) were a collection of Germanic tribes occupying the continental Europe north of the Alps. The most famous of the Franks (apologies to <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pepin_the_Short">Pepin</a>) is known almost exclusively by his French name Charlemagne (Char le Magne) despite that his name was actually Karl (Karl der Grosse). Add this to to wiki on “French-German Enmity.”</p>
<p>I remember thinking that it was pretty neat when I finally realized Charlemagne’s name is quite obviously “Charles the Great.” Investigating the relation between Charles, Char, and Karl, you quickly find an expansive list of other Karl derivatives: Carolina (North Carolina is named after Charles I, King of England), Charlotte (the city is named after the queen consort of George III), Caroline, Carla, Carl, Charlene, Carol, Carolyn, and Carlos.</p>

<p>R Markdown <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html">Notebooks</a> is a new feature for RStudio that allows for independent and interactive chunk execution, quick rendering of LaTeX, and selective updating of html files (i.e., the entire page does not have to re-rendered each time). This is a very cool advancement in literate programming that takes the best features of iPython notebooks and applies it to a R development environment.</p>
<p>My continuing <a href="https://github.com/tkthomas27/ISL-Notes">notes</a> on the <em>Introduction to Statistical Learning</em> showoff some of these features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Markdown capabilities</li>
<li>The ability to reference defined variables</li>
<li>See plots displayed below chunks.</li>
<li>See Tex code rendered as you go. The following will be automatically displayed as you type.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        E[(Y - \hat{Y})^2] &amp;= E[(f(X) + \epsilon - \hat{f}(X))^2]\\
        &amp;= \underset{Reducible}{[f(X) - \hat{f}(X)]^2} + \underset{Irreducible}{Var(\epsilon)}
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>I highly recommend you try it out. Reading about the features is quite underwhelming compared to seeing it in action.</p>
<p>To start a notebook you need to save a file as <code>.Rmd</code> and add a header like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>---
title: &quot;Notebook Title&quot;
output:
  html_notebook:
    toc: true
    number_sections: true
  pdf_document: default
---</code></pre>
<p>This will produce a PDF document with a table of contents and numbered sections.</p>

<p><em>The Multinational Company: In Retreat</em>: Multinationals, which account for a third of the world’s stock markets, are increasingly posting anemic performance results with declining profits and plunging ROE. The cause of this fall is that the opportunities that multinationals exploited in the international market are being “massaged” away: income is rising in the third world, mismatched tax treaties are being synchronized, and local firms are becoming more sophisticated. With a current rise in anti-globalism, the future direction and scale of multinationals are in question.</p>

<li><p><em>Replacing Obamacare: High Risk by Name</em>: The alternative to the ACA that Republicans are touting relies on high-risk pools. High-risk pools gather all the unhealthy people into a single tranche and charges them higher premiums, thus allowing healthier people to not subsidize the cost of less healthy people. The problem is, of course, that healthy people do end up subsidizing the unhealthy because the high-risk pools require extensive government backing which is turn funded by tax payers.</p></li>

<li>Maybe it shouldn’t be surprising that Princeton, the first football program, claims the most national titles at 29 — none of which occurred since 1950. Just to give you an idea of how ridiculous this idea is, Princeton’s first 7 national titles were won with with a total of 11 wins. Princeton claims national titles for years 1870 and 1872 were there final record was 1-0.</li>

<p>In this classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)#.22The_Butterfly_Dream.22">story</a>, the Chinese sage Zhuangzi (ca. 370 BCE) awakes from dreaming that he was a butterfly only to ask the question: am I a man dreaming of being a butterfly or am I a butterfly dreaming of being a man? Daoists, scholars, philosophers, poets, artists, and laymen alike have all been equally moved by so profound yet so simple of a question. Although the concept has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_argument">elaborated and explored</a> numerous times (there are certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasubandhu">more</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations_on_First_Philosophy">less</a> sophisticated takes on the idea), I believe Zhuangzi’s simple story has staying power due to its simultaneous depth and shallowness. The very form of the story, incredibly simple yet profound in implications, underlines the point that distinctions between deep and shallow — between anything in fact — is ultimately fruitless.</p>

<p>The earliest known representation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taijitu">Yin-Yang</a> is not from China but from the late Roman Empire (ca. 430). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notitia_Dignitatum"><em>Notitia Dignitatum</em></a>, which “details the administrative organization of the Eastern and Western Empires,” includes a depiction of the shield carrying a Yin-Yang symbol.</p>
<p>So does this mean China and Europe were trading ideas a millennium before the colonial period? Of course! Asia and Europe have been in contact for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Embassy_to_Augustus">long</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periplus_of_the_Erythraean_Sea">long</a> time. But <em>Notitia</em> is not the smoking gun. The current version of the <em>Notitia</em> is actually a Medieval copy of an ancient document — meaning that it’s about 1000 years younger than the 430 date.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Motoring_Enthusiast_Party">Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party</a> is a micro political party that remarkably won federal representation in 2013.

<li>The Senator representing AMEP, Ricky Muir, is a 32-year-old former timber worker</li>
<li>Mr. Muir only won .51% of the primary vote</li>
<li>Mr. Muir will make $190,000 a year — $16,000 more than a US Senator</li>

<p>As someone who started with Stata and R for data analysis, I’ve always wanted to try a more general use language like Python. I worked through <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org">Python the Hard Way</a> and played around with <a href="https://www.dataquest.io">Dataquest</a> (whose <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-setup-a-data-science-blog/">tips</a> helped me build this blog). However, the best way of learning I have found is writing algorithms in Python.</p>
<p>Two of the cooler functions I have come across are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#zip">zip</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists">pop</a>. <code>zip</code> essentially allows you to iterate over two iterables simultaneously. A trivial example would be</p>
<pre class="python"><code>x = [1,2,3]
y = [4,5,6]

for i,j in zip(x,y):
  print(i,j)</code></pre>
<p>the output would be <code>[1,4],[2,5][3,6]</code>. I can’t think of how much time this simple function would have saved me if it was available in Stata.</p>
<p><code>list.pop[i]</code> is like the opposite of <code>append</code>: it removes the specified element from the list. This might sound simple, but it is by far the easiest way of removing something from a list that I have come across in R or Stata. My first use of <code>pop</code> came in writing the <a href="https://github.com/tkthomas27/stanford_algos/blob/master/course1/count_inversions.py">inversion counting algorithm</a>. Here is a snippet (<code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are both arrays of numbers):</p>
<pre class="python"><code>while B and C:
    if B[0] &lt;= C[0]:
        outlist.append(B.pop(0))
    else:
        count += len(B)
        outlist.append(C.pop(0))</code></pre>
<p>This chunk of code does the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Checks if element 0 of <code>B</code> is less than or equal to element 0 of <code>C</code></li>
<li>If it is, then it removes that element from <code>B</code> and places it into <code>outlist</code></li>
<li>If it is not, then it increases <code>count</code> by the number of elements left in <code>B</code> (this is part of the counting inversions) and then removes that element from <code>C</code> and places it into <code>outlist</code> (the effect is two sorted arrays)</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Buttonwood</em>: This weeks Buttonwood column addresses one of the pitfalls of the current trend towards protectionist policies: shielding established yet failing companies from displacement by global competition. Specifically, a paper from the OECD finds that companies that owe more than they make (interest-coverage ratio of less than 1 and are over 10 years older) might be stifling growth and lowering labor productivity. These older, less profitable companies use their lobbying clout (leveraging their employment size, no doubt) to pressure their respective governments into passing protectionist policies. To be sure, however, this isn’t a Right v Left issue: Sandernistas and Corbynistas alike were clamoring for anti-globalist policies as well.</p>

<p><strong>NFL Conference Championship Games</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Patriots trounced the sleep-walking Steelers (I wonder how much that early morning wake up call affected them). I guess this should have been predictable, but the Patriots really haven’t played anyone recently so I though it would be closer. That being said, the Steelers implemented one of the worst gameplans in recent history by deciding to drop everyone in coverage and only sending a few rushers.</li>
<li>Similarly, the Falcons demolished Green Bay in another snooze-fest. I still think Aaron Rodgers is technically the best QB in the NFL right now, but even he can’t overcome the insane number of injuries they’ve had (particularly in the secondary.)</li>

<li><em>Silence</em>: Martin Scorcese’s passion project about Jesuit priests in early-modern Japan was right in my wheel house.

<ul>
<li><em>X-Files-Files with Kumail Nanjiani</em>: This is a fun podcast about the X-Files with <em>Silicon Valley</em> star Kumail Nanjiani. It’s pretty funny and appropriately intellectual given the excellent writing of the show. Some of his guests are quite good: Darin Morgan (Flukeman, writer of the best episodes of the X-Files), Glen Morgan (frequent writer for the X-Files, Darin’s brother), Chris Weitz (writer of <em>About a Boy</em> and <em>Rogue One</em>), and Dan Harmon (<em>Rick and Morty</em>) to name a few. I vividly remember watching the X-Files as a kid on Friday/Sunday nights and it’s been great reliving the zeitgeist of the moment.</li>
<li><em>Hacker’s: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em> by Steve Levy: This is a fun book about the history of hackers. So far I’ve finished the first part about the first hackers who grew out of the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT. Also of note is the hacker hatred of IBM — now that famous Ridley Scott-directed Apple commercial from the 1984 Super Bowl makes a lot more sense.</li>

<li><em>The Forever War</em> by Joe Haldeman: a mildly interesting but not very well written novel about a solider who, via time dilation effects of interstellar travel, lives over thousand years. Not terrible, but I’m not sure why this won so many awards.</li>
<li><em>The Book of the Dying Sun</em> by Gene Wolfe: on a recommendation from a friend I started reading this sci-fi fantasy novel. So far it is definitely better written than <em>The Forever War</em> and quite good at evocative imagery. I find his extensive blend of imaginary, literary, and archaic words particularly amusing.</li>
